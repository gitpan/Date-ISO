NAME
    Date::ISO - Perl extension for converting dates between ISO and
    Gregorian formats.

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::ISO;
      ($yearnumber, $weeknumber, $weekday) = iso($year, $month, $day);
      ($yearnumber, $weeknumber, $weekday) = localiso(time);

DESCRIPTION
    Convert dates between ISO and Gregorian formats.

  iso

            ($year, $week, $day) = iso($year, $month, $day);

    Returns the ISO year, week and day, when given the year, month, and day,
    as returned by localtime. (That is, months are zero-based, years are
    -1900.)

  inverseiso

            ($year, $month, $day) = inverse_iso($year, $week, $day);

    Given an ISO year, week, and day, returns year, month, and day, as
    localtime would give them to you.

  localiso

            ($year, $week, $day) = localiso(time);

    Given a time value (epoch time) returns the ISO year, week, and day.
